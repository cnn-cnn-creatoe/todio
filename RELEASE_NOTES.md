# ✨ SoftDo v1.5.1: The Deep Glass Update

> **"Clarity in every pixel."**

Building on the Silky Flow engine, v1.5.1 brings a massive upgrade to visual fidelity. We've introduced "Deep Glass" aesthetics and refined dark mode to be easier on the eyes.

## 🎨 Visual Upgrades

### 🌫️ Deep Glass Texture

We've added a subtle film grain noise overlay to the entire application. This mimics the physics of real frosted glass, giving the window a tangible, premium texture that standard CSS blur cannot achieve.

### 🕹️ Micro-Skeuomorphism

Buttons now have weight.

- **Inset Shadows**: Toggles and checkboxes press "into" the surface when clicked (reminiscent of iOS 17 control center).
- **Spring Physics**: Checkbox animations are now driven by a stiffer spring for a snappier, more mechanical feel.

### 👁️ Smart Contrast (Dark Mode)

- **Adaptive Text**: Headers now detect dark backgrounds and apply a "Light + Shadow" effect to ensure perfect readability on any wallpaper.
- **Refined Palette**: Dark mode logic has been updated to use `#1E1E2E` (Blue-Grey) instead of pure black for a softer look.
