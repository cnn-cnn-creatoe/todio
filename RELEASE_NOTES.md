# ✨ SoftDo v1.5.0: The Silky Update

> **"It's not just a todo list. It's digital furniture."**

We are thrilled to present **SoftDo v1.5.0**. This update is a complete reimagining of how the app _feels_, powered by our new Unified Physics Engine ("Silky Flow"), alongside official support for the Linux community.

## 🌊 Introducing "Silky Flow" (丝滑物理引擎)

We replaced the standard animation logic with a custom-tuned **Cubic Bezier** physics engine `[0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0]`.
Every interaction is now governed by this single mathematical truth.

- **Accordion Dynamics**: The window expands and contracts with the fluidity of a breathing organism. No more "teleporting" layouts.
- **Rhythmic Entry**: Tasks don't just appear; they cascade onto your screen with a satisfying, staggered motion.
- **Inertia**: Buttons and toggles react with weight and momentum.

## 🐧 Linux Support (Ubuntu / Debian)

SoftDo is now a first-class citizen on Linux.

- **Native `.deb`**: One-click install for Ubuntu, Debian, and Mint users.
- **Universal `.AppImage`**: Runs instantly on any distro (Arch, Fedora, openSUSE).
- **System Tray**: Fully integrated with standard Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE).
