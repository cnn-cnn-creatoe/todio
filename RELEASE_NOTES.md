# 🧪 SoftDo v1.5.1 (Private Beta)

> **Draft Release**: For internal testing only.

This build introduces the new **"Deep Glass"** aesthetic and skeuomorphic interactions.

## 🎨 Visual Upgrades

- **Micro-Skeuomorphism**: Checkboxes now have a satisfying "inset" feel when pressed, mimicking high-end iOS toggles.
- **Grain Texture**: Added a subtle film grain noise to the background for a more tangible, "frosted" texture.
- **Dark Mode Polish**: Reduced harsh contrasts; borders are now translucent and cleaner.

## 📥 Testing

Please verify:

1.  Does the checkbox click feel "snappier"?
2.  Is the background noise texture visible but not distracting?
3.  Do shadows look natural in Dark Mode?
